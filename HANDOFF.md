# Handoff - active work

Only work in progress lives here. When a section is finished, move it to [`HANDOFF_ARCHIVE.md`](HANDOFF_ARCHIVE.md)
(newest first) and delete it from this file. Conventions are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Fear of the Unknown - table play test (October 2026)

Port and browser play test are done and merged to `main` of the fork (`vdepagter/...`); see the archive. A PR to the
original repository (`Deusald/MyFathersWork-FanMadeCompanionApp`) can be opened from `main` or a branch at any time.

Next steps:
- Play a real game at the table (only crafted-save runs so far).
- Random sub-events not yet seen in the browser (they share code paths with tested ones): Liberal salts / Arise My
  Love / bribe / policy vote, Isolation smuggling trial outcomes, Foreigners Wall "Acceptance" + caravan visits,
  Creature cure accepted path, Gen I fates other than Creature, 2- and 4-player games.

## Music, sound effects and screen transitions (October 2026)

Implemented (uncommitted at time of writing); mapping from the Unity app in `docs/AUDIO_TRANSITIONS_MAP.md`.
`wwwroot/audio/*.mp3` (12 clips, ~9.3 MB, LFS), `wwwroot/js/audio.js` + `Shared/AudioService.cs`, `wwwroot/js/transitions.js`,
toggles in `Shared/AudioToggles.razor`. Sounds and transitions are derived in `Pages/Gameplay.razor` (`DetectScreenChange`);
scenario code only sets `GameplayWindow.SetCue` / `MarkFinalEnding` - never call audio from scenario code (mirror sandbox, undo, load).

Next steps:
- Test on a real iPhone/iPad (Safari autoplay unlock, MP3 playback) and at the table (volume of the effects vs music).
- Not ported (deliberate): voice-over, Unity bidding/reveal screen, clips the shipped app never played (map 2.3).
